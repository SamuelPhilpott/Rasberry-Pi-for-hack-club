## 10/17/2025 10 PM - Found the best Raspberry pi for the job  

After looking at all the avalable options and taking cost into account I had figured out a raspberry Pi 3 B+ modle will have enough power and ports to do the job potentialy making it extra but if i went lower it would not be enough I may need to see how much ram i need tho![bef8cda3-64ea-4098-bf18-8e731a6e9a0d_3b++Angle+2.webp](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c196127a823301f57df8f5715b6e2ffa9d9680fc/bef8cda3-64ea-4098-bf18-8e731a6e9a0d_3b%2B%2BAngle%2B2.webp)
